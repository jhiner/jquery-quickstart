# jquery-quickstart

This is a prototype jQuery quickstart project to demonstrate new OAuth as a service features with Auth0.

## Setup

Rename `auth0-variables.js.example` to `auth0-variables.js` and make sure that you have AUTH0_CLIENT_ID, AUTH0_DOMAIN, and AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL defined. Also, make sure to add the callback URL (for example `http://localhost:8080/`) in the **Allowed Callback URLs** section.

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run `npm install -g http-server`
3. run `http-server` in the directory of the project.

Go to `http://localhost:8080` and you'll see the app running :).
